## üöÄ Frontend Integration Examples

### JavaScript/TypeScript Examples

**1. Fetch player vs team statistics:**
```javascript
async function getPlayerVsTeamStats(playerId, teamId) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(
      `/api/players/statistics?playerId=${playerId}&queryType=vs-team&enemyTeamId=${teamId}`
    );
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching player stats:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

**2. Fetch all players:**
```javascript
async function getAllPlayers() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/players');
    const players = await response.json();
    return players;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching players:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

**3. Fetch all teams:**
```javascript
async function getAllTeams() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/teams');
    const teams = await response.json();
    return teams;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching teams:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### React Hook Example

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function usePlayerStats(playerId, teamId) {
  const [stats, setStats] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchStats() {
      try {
        setLoading(true);
        const response = await fetch(
          `/api/players/statistics?playerId=${playerId}&queryType=vs-team&enemyTeamId=${teamId}`
        );
        const data = await response.json();
        setStats(data);
      } catch (err) {
        setError(err);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    }

    if (playerId && teamId) {
      fetchStats();
    }
  }, [playerId, teamId]);

  return { stats, loading, error };
}
```

## üìù Notes for Frontend Developers

1. **Photo URLs**: Player photos are stored as relative paths (e.g., `/src/assets/players/lebron_james.jpg`). You'll need to serve these from your frontend assets.

2. **Error Handling**: Always implement proper error handling for API calls. The API returns structured error responses.

3. **Caching**: Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed data like player and team lists.

4. **Pagination**: For large datasets, use the `limit` parameter to implement pagination.

5. **Real-time Updates**: The `LastUpdated` field can help you determine if data has changed and needs refreshing.

6. **Performance**: Use the `fields` parameter to request only the data you need, reducing payload size.

7. **Season Filtering**: Use `seasonId` to filter data by specific seasons.

## üîß Development Tips

- Use the `/health` endpoint to verify API connectivity
- Check the `/api/players/statistics/query-types` endpoint to understand available query options
- All endpoints return JSON responses
- Error responses include descriptive error messages
- The API uses standard HTTP status codes (200, 400, 404, 500)
